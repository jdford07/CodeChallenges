# Personal Time Coding Challenge Documentation

This repository contains personal code solutions and detailed solution write-ups for challenges solved on popular programming challenge websites and the 6th edition of `Cracking the Coding Interview` during my free time.

## Programming Solutions

Each popular challenge website has a dedicated folder. Each specific completed challenge has a dedicated nested folder. Each specific completed challenge folder contains:

- Copy-pastable code solutions
  - My personally submitted, and accepted, solutions
  - Each language has a solution file
- Markdown solution write-up

## Programming Solution Write-Ups

The purpose of including structured solution write-ups is to detail strengths, pitfalls and overall sentiment encountered when solving the listed challenges.

The write-ups are intended to provide a raw historical insight into the solving of each documented solution.

Each write-up contains all necessary challenge details providing an all encompassing picture of:

- Where to find the challenge
- Challenge requirements synopsis
- How ***I*** solved the challenge
- What ***I*** could have done better
- Lessons learned
- Popular performant solutions from others
